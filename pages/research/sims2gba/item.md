## Item ID List
You can find a list of the Item IDs below, though before a few notes.

### Notes

- `0xE6` is the ID for an empty Item and not `0x0`.

- Items marked as `(Crash)` can cause the game to freeze when opening the Inventory (or any Item Packages such as from the Pawnshop etc i believe) or even to fully crash. Don't even try to use them. You are warned.

- Items marked as `???` are either Unknown (potential due to crashes) or i didn't came to a proper name idea for the Item.
