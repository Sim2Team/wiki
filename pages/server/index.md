## NOTE
With [S2GBADecomp](https://github.com/tssoret/S2GBADecomp) starting to get a larger project likely soon:tm:, a *new* Discord Server is there and does combine [Sim2Team](https://github.com/Sim2Team) and [tssoret](https://github.com/tssoret) into one!

Join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TR6BfHRqqj) if you want to be up-to-date with Sim2Team and tssoret projects.

### Welcome to the Sim2Server section of the wiki!
**You like the games such as the ones listed on the [main page](https://sim2team.github.io)? Then the Sim2Server might be a good place for you.**

*Of course you can also just chill on that server (though you'd likely have more fun there if you like one or more of the games). Maybe you also never heard of the games and want to try it out?*

- You can talk about the games, or also learn more about it or share your knowledge.

- You could also share your own created ROM Hacks for those games, or just talk about reverse engineering / save data stuff.

It doesn't matter how well you're experienced with the games, you can even be a newcomer to the games, or a master that can help out by questions or just be someone, that enjoys playing the games.


There are also some projects related about the games, such as [Sim2Editor](https://sim2team.github.io/sim2editor/), which is a web browser save editor for Currently: The Sims 2 (Game Boy Advance & Nintendo DS), or also straight researches about the Savefiles on [Sim2Wiki](https://sim2team.github.io/wiki/research). There is also [Optimum Alfred](https://github.com/Sim2Team/Optimum-Alfred-Bot), a discord bot for tssoret, which is still kinda a work in progress that should make the stay on that server more nicely or [S2GBADecomp](https://github.com/tssoret/S2GBADecomp), which is a work in progress disassembly and decompilation of The Sims 2 Game Boy Advance by tssoret.

**You can find more information about the Server on the card on the sidebar.**
