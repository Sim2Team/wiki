### What is this?
The Level System, also known as `ls` is a nice feature for active People.

You'll get Points on the Level System by being active on the Sim2Server and can collect fancy roles with colors.

But not only Points exist, also `Emotes` and `Contributions`, so you can see it like some kind of User "Stats".

NOTE: This only works, when Optimum Alfred is online and I hope to bring him Online as much as possible.

### What Roles do exist?
Currently, we have 11 Roles. The first 5 are "basic" roles (Sanity-0 until Sanity-4), while the next 6 are special roles (Zimmer until Emperor).

You can get them through Points and you can see how many you'll need for which role below.

| Level    | Points    | Color     |
| -------- | --------- | --------- |
| Sanity-0 | 8         | `#B9010B` |
| Sanity-1 | 500       | `#60BC7B` |
| Sanity-2 | 1.000     | `#B59C42` |
| Sanity-3 | 2.000     | `#A7A7D7` |
| Sanity-4 | 4.000     | `#A542A3` |
| Zimmer   | 7.000     | `#BAB748` |
| Keeble   | 10.000    | `#2A7B39` |
| Dripple  | 50.000    | `#5D8BB5` |
| Burple   | 100.000   | `#12CE61` |

| Emperor  | 1.000.000 | `#000893` |

### Interval
The bot has an implemented Interval of 30 seconds per message, so if you send more messages within 30 seconds, it won't count.

### Points Per Message
You will get 2 Points per counted message, however when it's Livestream time you can collect 4 Points instead in a Livestream thread.
