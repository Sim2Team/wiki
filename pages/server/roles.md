### Status Roles
We also have "Status" roles, so you can show what kind of player of these games you are, from newcomer up to masters!

- Game-Newcomer: The role for newcomer to the games
- Game-Enjoyer: The role for people that enjoy playing the games
- Game-Master: The role for people that are masters in the games

### Sanity Level Roles
We also have *new* roles for those that are being active on the Sim2Server.

You can get some nice colored roles with the activity on the Server, those can be unlocked with Points. There are 5 Levels, while they require the following points:

| Level | Points  | Color                     |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| 0     | 8       | Red                       |
| 1     | 500     | Green                     |
| 2     | 1000    | Yellow                    |
| 3     | 2000    | Silver                    |
| 4     | 4000    | Dark Orchid - Purple like |
