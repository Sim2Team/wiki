### Investigating Roles
These are the investigation / researching roles. The roles are not toggle-able and only given out to people that work actively or at least have experience in the category.

See below for all the Investigation Categories.

- Save-Investigator: Investigating the Save Files
- Cheat-Investigator: Investigating Cheats
- Internal-Investigator: Investigating the internal workings
- File-Investigator: Investigating the File System

### Status Roles
We also have "Status" roles, so you can show what kind of player of these games you are, from newcomer up to masters!

- Game-Newcomer: The role for newcomer to the games
- Game-Enjoyer: The role for people that enjoy playing the games
- Game-Master: The role for people that are masters in the games

### Other Roles
There are also other roles that likely fit in no category, hence "Other Roles".

- Updates: Get pinged when there is a new update on Sim2Editor for example.
