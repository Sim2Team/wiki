### Status Roles
We also have "Status" roles, so you can show what kind of player of these games you are, from newcomer up to masters!

- Game-Newcomer: The role for newcomer to the games
- Game-Enjoyer: The role for people that enjoy playing the games
- Game-Master: The role for people that are masters in the games

### Sanity Level Roles

***Roles***

We also have *new* roles for those that are being active on the Sim2Server.

You can get some nice colored roles with the activity on the Server, those can be unlocked with Points. There are 5 basic Levels but also 6 Special levels. Those can be unlocked with the following amount of Points:

| Level    | Points    | Color     |
| -------- | --------- | --------- |
| Sanity-0 | 8         | `#B9010B` |
| Sanity-1 | 500       | `#60BC7B` |
| Sanity-2 | 1.000     | `#B59C42` |
| Sanity-3 | 2.000     | `#A7A7D7` |
| Sanity-4 | 4.000     | `#A542A3` |
| Zimmer   | 7.000     | `#BAB748` |
| Keeble   | 10.000    | `#2A7B39` |
| Dripple  | 50.000    | `#5D8BB5` |
| Burple   | 100.000   | `#12CE61` |
| Ava      | 500.000   | `#3C1A77` |
| Emperor  | 1.000.000 | `#000893` |


***Interval***

The bot has an implemented Interval of 30 seconds per message, so if you send more messages within 30 seconds, it won't count.


***Points Per Message***

You will get 2 Points per counted message, however when it's Livestream time you can collect 4 Points instead in a Livestream thread.

***If you want to know your current points, just use `.ls` in the #bot-lounge channel when Optimum Alfred is online.***

### Other Roles
There are also other roles that likely fit in no category, hence "Other Roles".

- Updates: Get pinged when there is a new update on Sim2Editor for example.
