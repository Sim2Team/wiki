### Status Roles
We also have "Status" roles, so you can show what kind of player of these games you are, from newcomer up to masters!

- Game-Newcomer: The role for newcomer to the games
- Game-Enjoyer: The role for people that enjoy playing the games
- Game-Master: The role for people that are masters in the games
