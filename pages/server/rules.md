1. Don't break discord's Terms of Service/Community Guidelines. (See here for the [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)).

2. Don't talk or even discuss about piracy. That is a banned topic on this server.

3. Try to stay on topic. That means -> try to use the proper channels.

4. If you need to ask a question, directly ask the question and don't ask, if you can ask the question, because that only clutters the channels a lot more.
    - Check out the channel description and pins, maybe your question got answered already.
