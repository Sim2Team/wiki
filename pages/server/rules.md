1. Don't break discord's Terms of Service/Community Guidelines. (See here for the [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)).

2. Don't talk or even discuss about piracy. That is a banned topic on this server.

3. Be patient and polite. This is a friendly place, we don't need drama here.

4. Try to stay on topic. That means -> try to use the proper channels.

5. If you need to ask a question, directly ask the question and don't ask, if you can ask the question, because that only clutters the channels a lot more.
    - Check out the channel description and pins, maybe your question got answered already.

6. The rules can change at any moment, if necessary - so always keep a look at #entrance in case they change. This would of course be announced though in #bulletin-board.
